- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Devika, and here's a few words about me. 

My fascination for cars when I was younger eventually developed into a passion for vehicle engineering. This passion drove me to pursue higher education in this field and carried me through my education at Michigan Tech, where I found more resources available to me than I could have ever imagined. After two years of rigorous masterâ€™s program specialising in electric vehicles and controls at Tech, I am grateful to be able to contribute to the new era of mobility.

Currently, I am working as an xEV Advanced Simulation Engineer at Stellantis (Formerly Fiat Chrysler). I thoroughly enjoy working on the state-of-the-art electric vehicles and optimising powertrain control models, to improve their range and performance. Another interesting aspect of my job is to perform deep dive analysis of competitive electric vehicles and find enablers to improve performance and fuel economy.

Outside of work, I am an avid hiker and a recreational photographer. 

I enjoy meeting new people and hearing their perspectives. Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about emerging tech in automotive industry or trade stories of memorable hikes.
